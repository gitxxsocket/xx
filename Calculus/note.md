1 Calculus Relates Function(1) to Function(2)

2 Examples of Related Functions
    Distance and Speed & Height and Slope

3 Example
    Constant Speed Versus Changing Speed

4 Example
    Function (1) = Height of a Person
    Function (2) = Rate of Growth

5 Example
    Function (2) = Speed Increases at a Constant Rate
    find Function (2) =Distance

When the speed is constant ,we only need algebra

slope = up deivided by across
speed =  distance divided by time
